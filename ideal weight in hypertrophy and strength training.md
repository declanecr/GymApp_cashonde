To design effective formulas for choosing the ideal weight in hypertrophy and strength training, let's break it down by a few core components:
1. Determine Working Weight Based on 1RM and Rep Range

    Strength Level and Rep Range: Generally, training for muscle growth (hypertrophy) involves working at 60-80% of 1RM for 6-12 reps. For strength-focused hypertrophy, you may target the lower end of this range (6-8 reps at 75-80% of 1RM), and for pure hypertrophy, the higher end (8-12 reps at 60-75% of 1RM).
    Formula for Working Weight:
        Working Weight (WW) = 1RM × Percentage (e.g., 0.7 for 70%).
    Example: For an individual with a 1RM of 200 lbs targeting hypertrophy at 70% of their 1RM:
    WW=200×0.7=140 lbs
    WW=200×0.7=140 lbs
    Adjustment for Beginners vs. Advanced:
        Beginners: Start at 60-65% of 1RM for 8-12 reps, focusing on form and a slower rate of progression.
        Advanced Lifters: Can push closer to 80% 1RM with lower rep ranges, such as 6-8 reps, to create a greater stimulus for hypertrophy and strength.

2. Progression Rate and Overload Adjustments

    Beginners: Increase weight every 1-2 weeks if the target rep range is achieved consistently with good form. A safe progression rate is 2.5-5% of the current working weight.
    Advanced Lifters: Increase weight less frequently, perhaps every 3-4 weeks, by 1-2.5% of working weight or add extra sets/reps if weight progression stalls.

3. Adjusting for Different Muscle Groups

    Large Muscle Groups (e.g., quads, back, chest): Can handle slightly higher percentages of 1RM and often respond well to rep ranges of 6-10.
    Smaller Muscle Groups (e.g., biceps, triceps, shoulders): Benefit from slightly lower percentages (60-70% of 1RM) and higher reps (8-12) for hypertrophy to reduce injury risk and overtraining.
    Example Formulas:
        For Large Muscles (Legs, Back, Chest): WW = 1RM × (0.65 to 0.75)
        For Small Muscles (Biceps, Shoulders): WW = 1RM × (0.6 to 0.7)

4. Training Frequency and Recovery

    Beginners: Each muscle group 2x/week with 48-72 hours of recovery.
    Advanced: Each muscle group 1.5-2x/week depending on volume and intensity, with careful monitoring to avoid overtraining.

5. Practical Example

For a lifter with a 1RM of 300 lbs on the squat, aiming for hypertrophy:

    Large Muscle Group (Quadriceps) at 70% of 1RM for 8 reps:
    WW=300×0.7=210 lbs
    WW=300×0.7=210 lbs
    Progression: Increase weight by 5-10 lbs every 1-2 weeks if completing 8 reps consistently.

These formulas provide a solid baseline, allowing for modifications based on individual recovery, progress, and overall training goals. Adjustments in reps, weight, and progression rate will support steady muscle growth and strength gains through progressive overload.
